## Overview
ZKS is a **Trustless, Metadata-Free Anonymity Network** designed to supersede Tor. It introduces the **Faisal-Swarm Topology**, a triple-blind architecture that mathematically guarantees no single node can know both the source and destination of traffic.

## 🚀 The Core Inventions

### 1. Faisal-Swarm Topology (Triple-Blind)
Unlike Tor, where nodes connect directly (revealing IPs), ZKS nodes connect exclusively via **Blind Relays**.
*   **Result**: The Entry Node never sees the Exit Node's IP. The Exit Node never sees the Entry Node's IP.

### 2. Wasif-Vernam Cipher (Double-Key)
Traffic is encrypted using a distributed variant of the One-Time Pad.
*   **Key A (Local)**: Generated by your device.
*   **Key B (Remote)**: Generated by the **Swarm** (Distributed Entropy).
*   **Result**: Information-Theoretic Security. Even if the network is compromised, your data is mathematically undecryptable without your local key.

### 3. Swarm Entropy Tax
We do not trust centralized RNGs (like Cloudflare LavaRand).
*   **Mechanism**: Every peer in the network contributes random noise (entropy).
*   **Result**: The "Remote Key" is a product of thousands of random computers, making it impossible to predict or rig.

### 🛡️ Quantum-Proof Security
Unlike AES or RSA, which rely on mathematical problems (factoring) that Quantum Computers can solve, the **Wasif-Vernam Cipher** relies on **Entropy**.
*   **Mechanism**: We stream a continuous, non-repeating key generated from **Swarm Entropy** (True Randomness) and **Local CSPRNG**.
*   **Result**: To decrypt the traffic, an attacker must guess the random noise. This is not a math problem; it is a physical impossibility.
*   **Status**: Information-Theoretically Secure (approximated).
